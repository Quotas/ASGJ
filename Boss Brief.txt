Introduction:
Welcome to the customs inspection office!

As an inspection officer, your job is to examine goods that come through here and determine if they are Genuine or Fake.

You represent the front line defence that protects the people of our country from illicit and dangerous goods.

Every time you confiscate an illicit item you are making the world a better place by putting a spanner in the works of international organized crime.
